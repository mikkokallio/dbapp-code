# Minglerz.net

![workflow status](https://github.com/mikkokallio/dbapp-code/actions/workflows/main_functions-dbapp.yml/badge.svg)

## Overview

A user can create an account and log in to the app. Once logged in, a user can create events, comment on events any user has created, and register to join an event.

## Running the app

The app runs at https://minglerz.net/. Most functionality should work ok also on cell phone, but there are a few bugs still.

You can test the app by trying out the following features:
1. **Create a new user account and log in**. Try entering intentionally bad usernames and poor passwords first, then viewing the error messages and changing the values accordingly.
2. **Create a new place**. When searching for locations, use street name with address number and city, e.g. Lepp√§suonkatu 11, 00100 Helsinki. Otherwise, the results may be inaccurate. Try fooling the validation with weird inputs.
3. Admins only: You can delete places but only if no events are currently using that place.
4. **Create new events**. Here too, you can try submitting e.g. an empty event, then fixing the values according to instructions.
5. **Edit events** you have created or delete them. Admins can also edit or delete events created by other users.
6. While viewing events other people have created, **register to join an event, or comment on an event**. You can also check that you can't register to a past event or when max number of attendees is reached.
7. **View other users' profiles** in a popup view by clicking their username.
8. Click the user icon in the top bar to **view your own profile, and edit your profile or log out**. Password change doesn't work yet.

## Reviewing the code

The code is structured so that the application code is in the **FlaskApp** folder.

## Technologies used

* The app is written Python, SQL, HTML, and JS using Flask as the web framework and Bulma as a style library. 
* Azure Functions provides serverless compute for running Flask.
* Azure Database for PostgreSQL is used for persisting the app data.
* Azure Maps APIs are used for fetching street address information and displaying maps in events.
* Github and Github Actions are used for CI/CD, deploying the app automatically to Azure each time the main branch is updated.

## Todo list

The following features are on the roadmap, but haven't been implemented yet.

* When viewing the list of places, there should be a button "Create event here" as a shortcut so that the place gets inserted in the form automatically.
* User should be able to change password.
* Other users, too, should have full profiles. When viewing participant list in a modal, there should be links to full profiles.
* Bug: On mobile, viewing the list of who's going to an event sometimes triggers the button that registers participation.
* Admin users should be able to see deleted events and other hidden information. They should also be able to ban users or elevate regular users to admins.
* Users can cancel events ("soft delete") without immediately removing the event. Also, there should be a confirmation dialog for deleting an event.
